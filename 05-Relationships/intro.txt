    RELATIONSHIPS (Introduction)
    ----------------------------
        In RDBMS, a relationship describes how two tables are connected to each other.
        Real-world entities are always connected:
            A student has a college
            A customer has orders
            A book has authors
            A teacher has many subjects

        If the real world is connected, then our database should also store these connections.
        This connection between tables is called a "relationship".


    Why do we need relationships?
    -----------------------------
        Without relationships, every table would have repeated data.
        Example:
            If we store department name inside the employee table repeatedly,
            it wastes space and makes updates painful.

        Relationships allow us to:
            - Split data into logical tables
            - Avoid duplication
            - Connect tables in a meaningful way
            - Maintain accuracy of data (integrity)
            - Make searching and joining faster and cleaner

        The whole purpose of relationships is:
            "Store data separately but keep them connected safely."


    Basic Terms Used in Relationships
    ---------------------------------

    1) Primary Key (PK)
        PK uniquely identifies each row in a table.
        Every table should have exactly one PK.
        PK values cannot repeat and cannot be NULL.

    2) Foreign Key (FK)
        FK is a column that points to the Primary Key of another table.
        FK creates the actual relationship between two tables.

        Example:
            student.dept_id  → references department.id

    3) REFERENCES
        Used in SQL to say:
            "This foreign key belongs to that primary key."

        Example:
            FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES department(id)

    4) Parent Table / Referenced Table
        The table that owns the Primary Key.

    5) Child Table / Referencing Table
        The table that contains the Foreign Key.

    6) Referential Integrity
        A rule that ensures:
            - A child cannot refer to a parent that does not exist.
            - You cannot delete a parent row if child rows depend on it
            (unless CASCADE is used).

        This ensures data never becomes inconsistent.


    ER Diagrams (Entity–Relationship)
    ---------------------------------
        ER diagrams visually represent:
            - Entities (tables)
            - Attributes (columns)
            - Relationships between entities

        Common rules / notations:
            • PK is underlined
            • FK is shown with an arrow pointing to the parent table
            • Relationships are shown as lines
                --||-- (1 to 1)
                --<  or 1:M (one to many)
                ><-- many-to-many

        ER diagrams help us plan:
            - What tables are needed
            - What columns they should have
            - How tables connect


    Why relationships matter in real applications?
    ----------------------------------------------
        Relationships make your database:
            - Normalized
            - Consistent
            - Easy to update
            - Easy to join
            - Easy to scale

        Example:
            If we separate "students" and "departments" into two tables:
                student(dept_id) → department(id)
            we avoid repeating department name in every student row.

        This saves space, avoids mistakes, and keeps everything organized.


    Summary:
    -----------------
        - Real-world data is connected, so tables must also be connected.
        - Relationships describe how tables depend on each other.
        - Primary Keys identify rows.
        - Foreign Keys connect rows.
        - REFERENCES defines the link.
        - ER diagrams visually show all connections.
        - Without relationships, data becomes duplicated and messy.
        - With relationships, data becomes clean, normalized, and reliable.
