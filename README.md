# SQL Learning Repository

A beginner-friendly, step-by-step guide to learning SQL from scratch.

`The purpose of this repository is to help beginners learn SQL in a natural, logical sequence — without confusion or random jumps between topics.
The structure progresses from basics → constraints → clauses → DML → SELECT → relationships → joins → set operators → DDL/DCL → transactions → indexing → PL/SQL.`

Repository Structure

00 – Introduction
The foundation of SQL. This section covers how to create tables, understand data types, and perform basic data operations.
Includes:
- CREATE TABLE
- DROP TABLE
- INSERT
- Data Types

01 – Constraints
Constraints define rules for table columns and ensure data quality.
Includes:
NOT NULL, UNIQUE, DEFAULT, CHECK, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY

02 – Clauses
Clauses define the logical structure and flow of SQL queries.
Includes:
- WHERE
- GROUP BY
- HAVING
- ORDER BY
- LIMIT
- OFFSET

03 – DML
Data Manipulation Language operations used for modifying table data.
Includes:
- UPDATE
- DELETE

04 – Select Basics
Strengthens understanding of SELECT queries. Covers filtering, sorting, and pagination.
Includes:
- Filtering (LIKE, BETWEEN, IN, AND/OR/NOT)
- ORDER BY
- LIMIT/OFFSET

05 – Relationships
Before learning JOINs, it is essential to understand how tables relate to each other.
Includes:
- One-to-One
- One-to-Many
- Many-to-Many

06 – Joins
The most important part of SQL. Joins allow combining data from multiple tables.
Includes:
- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN
- RIGHT JOIN
- FULL JOIN
- CROSS JOIN
- SELF JOIN

07 – Set Operators
These operators combine the results of two SELECT queries.
Includes:
- UNION
- UNION ALL
- INTERSECT
- EXCEPT

08 – Remaining Topics (DDL + DCL)
Structural and permission-related operations.
Includes:
- ALTER TABLE
- TRUNCATE
- RENAME
- VIEWS
- DCL (GRANT, REVOKE)

09 – Transactions
Ensures data consistency and reliability.
Includes:
- COMMIT
- ROLLBACK
- SAVEPOINT
- Isolation Levels

10 – Indexing and Keys
Fundamentals of performance tuning.
Includes:
- What is an Index
- B-Tree Index
- Composite Index
- Clustered vs Non-Clustered Keys

11 – PL/SQL
Procedural SQL for writing logic inside the database.
Includes:
- Variables
- Loops
- Conditions
- Cursors
- Exception Handling
- Stored Procedures
- Functions
- Triggers
- Packages
