Constraints are like some rules for a specific column/attribute.
They assure record should be inserted meaningfully, they help to avoid meaningless (unlogical) data.

A table is schema is good, if it's columns have right constraints applied,
and there should be constraints for a column while creating a table.

Note :- 
    Applying a constraint for a column is optional, we can still create a table, without applying any constraint.

the syntax to apply a constraint on a column is like this

    -> column_name data_type CONSTRAINT

    -> CREATE TABLE table_name(
            column_1 data_type CONSTRAINT,
            column_2 data_type CONSTRAINT,
            column_N data_type CONSTRAINT
    );

    -> column_name data_type CONSTRAINT_1 CONSTRAINT_2
    ....A column can have multiple constraints
    
    Constraints in SQL :-

        1. NOT NULL :-
            If applied for a column, they that column's value can not set to null.
            for example, Student's name column should not contain null values, as every student has a name

        2. UNIQUE :-
            If applied for a column, it does not allow duplicate values for that column
            for example, values like email_id and phone_number are UNIQUE for individuals.

        3. CHECK (condition) :-
            If applied for a column, it does not allow a record to be inserted if the condition does not met.
            for example: we can write check for student percentage, as percentage is always between 0 to 100.
            it won't allow a value out of (0-100) this range.

        4. default <default_value> :-
            If applied for a column, while inserting a record, if we does not provide any value for this column, it will automatically take the default value and insert the record with the default value
            for example :- we can use the current_timestamp as default value for CREATED_AT column.

        5. PRIMARY KEY :-
            It used to uniquely identify a record in a table.
            It is a combination of not null and unique.
            A table can have only one primary key.
            Primary keys are mainly used to join two tables....

        6. FOREIGN KEY:
            Links two tables by referencing the PRIMARY KEY of another table, ensuring referential integrity.
